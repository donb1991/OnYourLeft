# On Your Left

On Your Left was created to help runners find music they like that also helps them meet their running goals. While listening to music we match our stride to the beats of the that music. Depending on how fast you want to run there is an optimal stride to achieve that pace. Listening to a song that has one beat per stride will help you keep that pace. With On Your Left you can search for music, create a playlist, and have it on your Spotify account ready to listen to right away.
